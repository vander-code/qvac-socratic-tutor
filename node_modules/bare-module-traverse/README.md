# bare-module-traverse

Low-level module graph traversal for Bare. The algorithm is implemented as a generator function that yields either modules to be read, modules to be probed for existence, resolutions to be transformed, prefixes to be listed, sets of imports to be resolved, child dependencies to be traversed, or resolved dependencies of the module graph. As a convenience, the main export is a synchronous and asynchronous iterable that relies on modules being read, modules being probed, resolutions being transformed, and prefixes being listed by callbacks. For asynchronous iteration, the callbacks may return promises which will be awaited before being passed to the generator.

```
npm i bare-module-traverse
```

## Usage

For synchronous traversal:

```js
const traverse = require('bare-module-traverse')

function readModule(url) {
  // Read `url` if it exists, otherwise `null`
}

function* listPrefix(url) {
  // Yield URLs that have `url` as a prefix. The list may be empty.
}

for (const dependency of traverse(new URL('file:///directory/file.js'), readModule, listPrefix)) {
  console.log(dependency)
}
```

For asynchronous traversal:

```js
const traverse = require('bare-module-traverse')

async function readModule(url) {
  // Read `url` if it exists, otherwise `null`
}

async function* listPrefix(url) {
  // Yield URLs that have `url` as a prefix. The list may be empty.
}

for await (const dependency of traverse(
  new URL('file:///directory/file.js'),
  readModule,
  listPrefix
)) {
  console.log(dependency)
}
```

## API

See the [`bare-module-traverse` reference](https://docs.pears.com/reference/bare/modules/bare-module-traverse).

## Algorithm

The following generator functions implement the traversal algorithm. The yielded values have the following shape:

**Source module**

A module to be read. The driver returns its source if it exists, otherwise `null`. When `artifact` is `true`, the module is an addon or asset whose contents are loaded lazily and referenced by path. A driver that only needs to locate such artifacts, such as a module loader, may return `null` without reading, having already established existence by probing; a driver that embeds their contents, such as a bundler, reads them as normal.

```js
next.value = {
  module: URL,
  artifact: boolean
}
```

**Probed module**

A module whose existence is to be tested without reading its full source, such as when locating an addon or asset. The driver returns `true` if it exists, `false` if it doesn't, or `undefined` if probing isn't supported, in which case existence is instead determined by reading the module.

```js
next.value = {
  probe: URL
}
```

**Resolved module**

A resolved, existing module whose URL is to be transformed. The driver returns the URL to use in its place, applying any post-resolution transform, such as canonicalizing symlinks with `realpath`, or the URL unchanged.

```js
next.value = {
  resolution: URL
}
```

**File prefix**

A prefix to be listed. The driver returns the URLs that have it as a prefix, of which there may be none.

```js
next.value = {
  prefix: URL
}
```

**Import set**

A set of independent imports to resolve. Each generator must be driven to completion before the parent generator is resumed, since the parent's resolved imports aren't complete until they are. The generators yield the same values as any other and may themselves yield dependency subgraphs to be traversed. A driver may drive them one at a time or, as their resolutions are independent, concurrently.

```js
next.value = {
  links: [Generator]
}
```

**Dependency subgraph**

A child subgraph to be traversed by driving its generator as the parent is driven. If `deferred` is `true`, it must be traversed only once all non-deferred subgraphs have been, ensuring, for example, that a module reached both as an import and as an asset is claimed by the import traversal first.

```js
next.value = {
  children: Generator,
  deferred: boolean
}
```

**Dependency node**

A fully resolved node of the module graph and the traversal's output. This is what the iterable forms yield to the caller.

```js
next.value = {
  dependency: {
    url: URL,
    source: 'string' | Buffer,
    type: constants.SCRIPT,
    // The type the module has on its own, ignoring import attributes, or 0 if
    // it has no type of its own.
    naturalType: constants.SCRIPT,
    imports: {
      // See https://github.com/holepunchto/bare-module#imports
    },
    lexer: {
      imports: [
        // See https://github.com/holepunchto/bare-module-lexer#api
      ],
      exports: [
        // See https://github.com/holepunchto/bare-module-lexer#api
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

To drive the generator functions, a recursive routine like the following can be used:

```js
const artifacts = { addons: [], assets: [] }
const visited = new Set()

const queue = [traverse.module(url, null, {}, artifacts, visited)]
const deferred = []

function drive(generator) {
  let next = generator.next()

  while (next.done !== true) {
    const value = next.value

    if (value.module) {
      // Read `value.module` if it exists, otherwise `null`. When
      // `value.artifact` is `true`, the module is an addon or asset that may be
      // left unread, returning `null`, unless its contents are needed
      let source

      next = generator.next(source)
    } else if (value.probe) {
      // Test whether `value.probe` exists, returning `true`, `false`, or
      // `undefined` if probing isn't supported
      let exists

      next = generator.next(exists)
    } else if (value.resolution) {
      // Transform `value.resolution`, e.g. canonicalize it with `realpath`, or
      // pass it through unchanged
      let resolution = value.resolution

      next = generator.next(resolution)
    } else if (value.prefix) {
      // List the modules that have `value.prefix` as a prefix
      let modules

      next = generator.next(modules)
    } else if (value.links) {
      // Drive each import to completion before resuming; their resolutions are
      // independent, so a concurrent driver may instead drive them in parallel
      for (const link of value.links) drive(link)

      next = generator.next()
    } else if (value.children) {
      // Defer the subgraph if requested, otherwise traverse it next
      if (value.deferred) deferred.push(value.children)
      else queue.push(value.children)

      next = generator.next()
    } else {
      const dependency = value.dependency

      next = generator.next()
    }
  }
}

while (queue.length > 0 || deferred.length > 0) {
  drive(queue.length > 0 ? queue.pop() : deferred.shift())
}
```

Options are the same as `traverse()` for all functions.

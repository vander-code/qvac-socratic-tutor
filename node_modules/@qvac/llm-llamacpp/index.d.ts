         * anchor a full-state snapshot, because the recurrent half cannot be
         * rewound by dropping cells; pure-attention models anchor a bare position
         * and rewind with a tail trim.

         * No structural reasoning marker is seeded or replayed, so the compacted
         * cache is preamble plus answer with no `<think>` / `</think>` scaffold
         * left behind, and close-marker length decides nothing: a marker that

         * that force-open the reasoning channel during prefill and templates that
         * let the model generate the opener are both supported; on the
         * generated-opener path the sampled pieces that open the block are clipped
         * out of the replay rather than rebuilt.
         *
         * Prefill-only (cache-warm) requests anchor nothing: they never enter
         * generation and cannot emit reasoning tokens.
         *
         * Uniform hard-fail contract: any inability to remove the reasoning
         * span from cache, whether the boundary anchor, the rewind, or the
         * replay step, is surfaced to the caller as a `StatusError`. There is no
         * soft-failure counter: if the feature is
         * enabled and cache cleanup cannot complete, the final request result is
         * failed rather than reported as a successful answer with the reasoning span
         * still resident in cache.
         *
         * Streaming caveat: token callbacks (`outputCallback` / batch `onToken`) are
         * invoked during generation, while reasoning-block compaction runs at
         * end-of-generation. If compaction fails, streaming callers may already have
         * received partial or complete text. Treat streamed text as tentative until
         * the request completes successfully; non-streaming callers receive no
         * successful returned answer on this failure path.
         *
         * Before throwing, the affected sequence is cleaned up so that the
         * next request on the same context starts from a coherent state:
         *   * Boundary-anchor failure: nothing has been rewound yet, so the
         *     driver rolls back to its pre-prompt checkpoint (or clears the
         *     sequence entirely on restore underflow) and resets positional
         *     accounting, then rethrows.
         *   * Rewind or replay failure: compaction rewinds before it replays,
         *     so live KV has already been written to by this point and a tail
         *     trim can no longer reach a coherent state. The compactor
         *     best-effort wipes the sequence and the driver zeroes its

         *     `remove_thinking_from_context` hard-fail).
         *   - Graceful cancel of a hybrid / recurrent request whose driver
         *     cannot roll live memory back to the pre-request cursor —
         *     either the recurrent full-state restore was refused, or no
         *     pre-request snapshot exists yet the driver advanced past the
         *     pre-request cursor. Cancels that roll back cleanly still save.
         *
         * On both skip paths the sequence's in-memory KV is still cleared, so
         * subsequent requests decode from a coherent baseline; only the
         * on-disk cache is untouched. Pure-attention drivers always roll back
         * via `removeLastNTokens` and therefore save on cancel as usual.

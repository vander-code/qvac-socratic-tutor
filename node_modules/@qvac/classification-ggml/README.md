# @qvac/classification-ggml

GGML-powered image classification addon for QVAC. Runs a fine-tuned MobileNetV3-Small 3-class triage CNN on the CPU backend of `libggml` and exposes a small, stable JavaScript API. Now intended for a specific image triage, but can be easily adapted for other classification tasks.

Package name: `@qvac/classification-ggml`  
Directory: `packages/classification-ggml`

## Install

This addon is published to the `@qvac` scope and consumed like any other QVAC native addon. When used from the monorepo, `npm install` resolves `@qvac/infer-base` and `@qvac/logging` via the workspace.

## Quickstart

```js
const ImageClassifier = require('@qvac/classification-ggml')

const classifier = new ImageClassifier()
await classifier.load()

const imageBuffer = fs.readFileSync('./my-image.jpg')
const result = await classifier.classify(imageBuffer)
// [ { label: 'food',   confidence: 0.93 },
//   { label: 'other',  confidence: 0.05 },
//   { label: 'report', confidence: 0.02 } ]

await classifier.unload()
```

### Raw RGB input

```js
const result = await classifier.classify(rgbBuffer, {
  width: 320,
  height: 240,
  channels: 3,
})
```

### topK filter

By default `classify()` returns one entry per class, sorted from most likely to least likely. Pass `topK: N` to keep only the top `N` results — for example `topK: 1` returns just the single highest-scoring class:

```js
const best = await classifier.classify(buf, { topK: 1 })
```

### Parameters

#### `new ImageClassifier(opts?)`

All constructor options are optional.


| Option         | Type                | Default                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `modelPath`    | `string`            | Bundled `weights/mobilenetv3_3class_v3_fp16.gguf`     | Absolute path to an FP16 GGUF file. Override only when pointing at a custom fine-tune produced by the ONNX→GGUF conversion guide. Also overridable via the `QVAC_CLASSIFICATION_MODEL_PATH` env variable.                                                                                                                              |
| `logger`       | `QvacLogger`-shaped | `null`                                                | A sink with optional `error / warn / info / debug(msg)` methods (compatible with `@qvac/logging`). Receives JS-side `info` from a successful `load()` and `error` from a failed `load()`. With `nativeLogger: true`, also receives forwarded native `LogMsg` events at `info` level. Always honoured, regardless of `nativeLogger`.    |
| `nativeLogger` | `boolean`           | `false`                                               | When `true`, native C++ `QLOG(...)` lines from inside the addon's model-loading and graph code are forwarded to `logger`. Disabled by default because the underlying `qvac-lib-inference-addon-cpp` logger is a process-wide singleton with a static `uv_async_t` that is not safe across rapid create/destroy cycles (e.g. in tests). |


#### `await classify(imageInput, options?)`


| Parameter                 | Type     | Default                   | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `imageInput` *(required)* | `Buffer` | `Uint8Array`              | —                                                                                                                                                               |
| `options.topK`            | `number` | `undefined` (all classes) | If set, the returned array is truncated to this many entries (top-K highest confidences). Must be a positive integer. Passing a value ≥ class count is a no-op. |
| `options.width`           | `number` | —                         | **Required** for raw RGB input. Integer > 0. The underlying buffer must be exactly `width × height × channels` bytes; any mismatch throws a structured error.   |
| `options.height`          | `number` | —                         | **Required** for raw RGB input. Integer > 0.                                                                                                                    |
| `options.channels`        | `3`      | —                         | **Required** for raw RGB input. Must be exactly `3`. Grayscale and RGBA are not supported — decode or drop the alpha channel on the caller side.                |


Returns `Promise<ClassificationResult[]>` where each entry is `{ label: string; confidence: number }`. The array is sorted by `confidence` descending, confidences are softmax probabilities in `[0, 1]` summing to ≈ 1, and `label` comes from the loaded GGUF's `mobilenet.class_N` metadata (so a future fine-tune can introduce new label strings without a code change).

#### `await load()` / `await unload()` / `await destroy()`

None take arguments. `load()` is idempotent — calling it twice is a no-op (check `getState().configLoaded` if you want to verify). `unload()` safely tears down the native handle and may be called multiple times. `destroy()` is equivalent to `unload()` plus a sticky `destroyed` flag in `getState()` — useful if your code wants to refuse reuse of a released instance.

## Output contract

- An array of `{ label: string, confidence: number }`.
- Sorted by `confidence` descending.
- `confidence` values are softmax probabilities in `[0, 1]` and sum to ≈ 1.
- Labels come from the GGUF metadata (`mobilenet.class_0/1/2`). For the bundled weights these are `food`, `report`, `other`.

## Build (from source, monorepo)

Prerequisites: clang (LLVM ≥ 19) with matching `libc++-dev`, vcpkg, bare ≥ 1.24, bare-make. CI pins the exact LLVM major via the shared `setup-llvm` action; locally any recent clang works.

```bash
cd packages/classification-ggml
npm install
bare-make generate
bare-make build
bare-make install
```

One-liner: `npm install && bare-make generate && bare-make build && bare-make install`.

## Testing

```bash
npm run test:integration     # brittle + bare JS integration tests (desktop)
npm run test:cpp             # GoogleTest C++ unit tests
npm run test:mobile:generate # regenerate test/mobile/integration.auto.cjs
npm run test:mobile:validate # verify mobile test file structure
```

Integration tests live in `test/integration/*.test.js` and use the 6 sample images under `test/images/` (two images per class).

### Mobile tests

Mobile tests use the shared `qvac-test-addon-mobile` framework. The `test/mobile/integration.auto.cjs` file is auto-generated by `scripts/generate-mobile-integration-tests.js` from every `*.test.js` under `test/integration/`, so adding a new integration test automatically exposes it on mobile too.

Before the mobile harness can be built, run

```bash
npm run mobile:copy-prebuilds
```

to populate `test/mobile/testAssets/` (driven by `scripts/copy-mobile-test-assets.js`). The script (a) fans out the single arm64 prebuild into the per-flavour directories the framework expects under `prebuilds/`, (b) copies the FP16 GGUF weights with a `.gguf.bin` suffix so the React Native bundler treats them as a binary asset, and (c) copies every `test/images/*.{jpg,jpeg,png}` into `testAssets/` so the integration tests can resolve them via `global.assetPaths` on-device. None of these copied files are checked into git. See [test/mobile/README.md](test/mobile/README.md) for the lifecycle note about the shared native logger.

## Platform support


| Platform            | CPU | Notes            |
| ------------------- | --- | ---------------- |
| Linux x64           | ✅   |                  |
| Linux arm64         | ✅   |                  |
| macOS arm64 (Apple) | ✅   |                  |
| macOS x64 (Intel)   | ✅   |                  |
| Windows x64         | ✅   |                  |
| Android arm64       | ✅   | `c++_shared` STL |
| iOS arm64           | ✅   |                  |


All platforms are produced by the shared `reusable-prebuilds.yml`
matrix and merged into a single `prebuilds` artifact for downstream
consumption. GPU (Vulkan / Metal / CUDA) is not currently supported.

## Performance

Depending on the platform, one call to `classifier.classify(buffer)` takes from a few tens to a couple of hundred milliseconds.

### What affects `classify()` latency

- **CPU thread pool** — libggml sizes its internal CPU worker pool to `std::thread::hardware_concurrency` on every platform. The addon does not expose a tuning knob for this; if a future need arises, raise an issue and we can add one.
- **Input size** — the JPEG/PNG decode and the `stb_image_resize2` bilinear pass scale with source pixel count. The 224×224 tensor pass is fixed-cost; a 12 MP phone photo adds real overhead vs. a 640×480 webcam frame.
- **First-call overhead** — `load()` already runs a full-pipeline warmup (synthetic-pattern pass through preprocess + GGML compute + output read) before returning, so the GGML compute buffers, weight buffer, and worker thread are fully materialised when the first `classify()` is dispatched. Even so, the first user-supplied call is typically a few tens of milliseconds slower than the steady-state average.
- **Re-use** — `load()` once, `classify()` many times. Tearing down and rebuilding the model for each image is roughly 4–6× slower end-to-end and is never necessary outside of tests.

### Memory footprint


| Component                                                  | Size            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Bundled FP16 weights (mmapped)                             | 2.94 MB         |
| Backend weight buffer (FP16 + folded BN + FP32 classifier) | ≈ 5.5 MB        |
| Intermediate activations (compute buffer)                  | single-digit MB |
| **Total resident** during inference                        | **~8–10 MB**    |


All GGML compute buffers (input tensor, intermediate activations, output) are allocated **once** at `load()` time and reused on every `classify()` call — `ggml_backend_tensor_set` / `_get` are the only operations that touch them per request. Per-call C++ allocations are bounded: one input-buffer copy across the bare-runtime boundary, the decoded RGB buffer, the resized 224×224 RGB buffer, the WHCN F32 tensor, and the 3-element softmax + result vectors. Multiple `ImageClassifier` instances each keep their own compute buffer and worker thread — you pay the ~8 MB once per instance.

### Why FP16 weights?

FP16 was chosen because it matches FP32 top-1 accuracy on the internal validation set while halving the on-disk footprint (≈3 MB vs ≈6 MB) and giving a measurable inference speed-up on every CPU backend we ship. More aggressive quantizations (Q8_0, Q4_K and below) were evaluated on the same validation set and showed noticeable accuracy degradation, which for a 3-class triage model is not acceptable. If you fine-tune your own MobileNetV3-Small, keep FP16 as the publish format unless you re-run the full validation suite at the lower precision.

### Measuring locally

The integration suite hooks the shared `scripts/test-utils/performance-reporter.js` via `test/integration/utils.js`. Running

```bash
npm run test:integration
```

writes `test/results/performance-report.json` with one `total_time_ms` entry per sample image, and in GitHub Actions also emits a Markdown step summary.

## Architecture

See `[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)` for the MobileNetV3-Small layer breakdown and graph construction notes, and `[docs/data-flow.md](docs/data-flow.md)` for the end-to-end request flow.

### Why a custom GGML graph?

`llama-cpp` doesn't support CNN architectures, so this addon bypasses `llama.cpp` entirely and talks to the stable `ggml_*` / `ggml_backend_*` public API.

For this MobileNetV3-Small the GGML CPU backend is, in most configurations, slower per call than the same network running on a mature PyTorch or ONNX Runtime build with their hand-tuned convolution kernels. Because the model is very small (≈2.5 M params, single-digit-millisecond compute on a modern phone), the absolute gap is negligible for a triage workload and is dominated by image decode and JS↔native marshalling. If a substantially larger classifier is ever added on top of this same scaffolding, expect to invest extra effort in graph-level optimisations (operator fusion, matmul tiling, FP16 SIMD kernels, threadpool sizing) before the GGML path is competitive.

## Converting a new model

If you fine-tune or swap the underlying MobileNetV3 model, follow `[docs/onnx-to-gguf-conversion.md](docs/onnx-to-gguf-conversion.md)`. The graph construction is parameterised by `BLOCKS` in `MobileNetGraph.hpp` — only classes and weights change between fine-tunes.

## Troubleshooting

- **“MobileNet GGUF weights not found”**: the default path is `<package>/weights/mobilenetv3_3class_v3_fp16.gguf`. Override with `new ImageClassifier({ modelPath: '/abs/path.gguf' })` or set the `QVAC_CLASSIFICATION_MODEL_PATH` env variable.
- **All predictions look wrong**: verify the BN epsilon is still `0.001` (see the guarded unit test) — the architecture is unusually sensitive to this constant.
- **Build fails looking for `stb_image.h`**: make sure the `stb` vcpkg port is installed. The `vcpkg-configuration.json` pins it.
- **Build fails resolving `qvac__fabric@0.bare`**: the shared ggml runtime ships in the `@qvac/fabric` npm dependency and is not bundled into this addon. Run `npm install` so `node_modules/@qvac/fabric/prebuilds/` is populated before `bare-make generate`/`build`.
- **Runtime error “no backends are loaded” on desktop Linux**: the ggml backend `.so` files are loaded directly from `@qvac/fabric` (`node_modules/@qvac/fabric/prebuilds/<host>/qvac__fabric/`), not from this addon. Ensure the `@qvac/fabric` dependency is installed and not pruned.

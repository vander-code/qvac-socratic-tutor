# @qvac/tts-ggml

Text-to-speech Bare addon backed by the [`qvac-tts.cpp`][qvac-tts-cpp]
GGML library.  Wraps multiple engines under one package: **Chatterbox**
(Turbo English + multilingual), **Supertonic** (v3 31-language preferred;
v1/v2 still loadable), **Parler** (mini/large English + indic 21-language,
description-conditioned with voice/emotion templates), **CosyVoice3**
(Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B, instruct-conditioned, 24 kHz, CPU with opt-in
Metal on Apple, CUDA/Vulkan on Linux, Vulkan on Windows, and OpenCL/Adreno
GPU offload on Android), and **Audio8**
(DualAR + neural codec, in-process voice cloning, desktop GPU), plus optional
LavaSR neural denoise + 48 kHz bandwidth-extension enhancement.  Unsure
which checkpoint to stage? Start with [Choosing a model](#choosing-a-model).


Runs in-process with a persistent native engine — the GGUFs, the S3Gen
preload, the ggml backend, and any voice-conditioning tensors are
loaded once and reused across every synthesis call.  GPU acceleration
(Metal on macOS/iOS, CUDA or Vulkan on Linux, Vulkan on Windows,
Vulkan / OpenCL on Android) is **opt-in** via `config: { useGPU: true }`;
the default is CPU.  On
Android `useGPU` flows through to `tts-cpp`, which picks the GPU
backend per its own per-vendor allowlist (Adreno → OpenCL,
Xclipse/Mali → Vulkan). Parler supports Apple/Metal and the
validated Android paths, including Vulkan on ARM Mali (see
[Backends & GPU acceleration](#backends--gpu-acceleration)). Audio8 supports
CUDA/Vulkan offload on Linux and Vulkan on Windows.

## Features

- Batch synthesis (`run({ input })` → single PCM buffer).
- **Sentence-granularity streaming** — `runStreaming(asyncIterable)`:
  yields one audio chunk per input sentence.
- **Native per-chunk streaming** — set `streamChunkTokens` and audio
  flows out of the C++ engine chunk-by-chunk as T3 tokens produce
  S3Gen+HiFT output; sub-second first-audio-out inside a single
  utterance.
- **Voice cloning** from a reference wav (or a pre-baked profile dir);
  on Audio8 the reference is encoded in-process and can be switched per
  call.
- **CPU by default**, GPU (Metal / Vulkan / OpenCL) opt-in via
  `config.useGPU: true` on GPU-capable hosts — including Android, where
  `tts-cpp` selects the GPU backend per its per-vendor allowlist (see
  [Backends & GPU acceleration](#backends--gpu-acceleration)).
- **Dynamic backend loading on Android** — per-arch CPU + Vulkan +
  OpenCL `.so` files ship under `prebuilds/<bare-target>/qvac__tts-ggml/`
  and are picked up at runtime via the new `backendsDir` option (see
  [Backends & GPU acceleration](#backends--gpu-acceleration)).
- **Cancellation** via `model.cancel()` — stops T3 decode on the next
  token; in-flight S3Gen chunk runs to completion.

## Choosing a model

Pick a **specific GGUF** (or CosyVoice3 model directory), not only an engine
family. Capabilities overlap; the tables below weight language coverage,
latency, size, and control surface so the default recommendation is
obvious for each job.

### Decision guide

| If you need… | Use this model | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lowest RTF on phones / edge devices | `supertonic3-q4_0.gguf` (or `supertonic3-q8_0.gguf` for quality) | ~80 MB (`q4_0`) / ~126 MB (`q8_0`); 31 languages. Prefer v3 over v1/v2. |
| English + voice cloning + low first-audio latency | `chatterbox-t3-turbo.gguf` + `chatterbox-s3gen.gguf` | Reference-wav / voice-profile cloning; native `streamChunkTokens` chunk streaming. Native 24 kHz. |
| Multilingual + voice cloning (EU / CJK) | `chatterbox-t3-mtl.gguf` + `chatterbox-s3gen-mtl.gguf` | en/es/fr/de/pt/it/zh/ja/ko/…; same cloning + streaming surface as Turbo. |
| Voice cloning at 44.1 kHz with nothing pre-baked | `audio8-lm-q8_0.gguf` + `audio8-codec-decoder-q8_0.gguf` (+ `audio8-codec-encoder-q8_0.gguf` to clone) | Clones from a reference wav **and its transcript**, encoded in-process — no enrolment step, no voice profile. Whole-utterance only (no native chunk streaming). |
| Indic languages | `parler-indic-q8_0.gguf` | 21 Indic languages; voice / emotion templates. Emotion is officially tested on 10 languages — see [Parler descriptions & emotions](#parler-descriptions--emotions) (or the upstream model card). Native 44.1 kHz. |
| Chinese dialects (Cantonese, Sichuan, Shanghai, …) | CosyVoice3 dir (`cosyvoice3-llm-*.gguf` + flow / hift / `voice.gguf`) | Instruct-conditioned; 17 dialects via `instruct: { dialect: '…' }`. CPU, with opt-in GPU offload (Metal on Apple, Vulkan on Linux/Windows, OpenCL/Adreno on Android); native 24 kHz. |
| Zero-shot / cross-lingual cloning (multilingual) | CosyVoice3 dir + `cosyvoice3-s3tok-*.gguf` + `cosyvoice3-campplus-*.gguf` | Clones from a reference wav; its transcript (`promptText`) selects zero-shot, omitting it selects cross-lingual (timbre only, any target language). Composes with `instruct`. |
| Description-conditioned English (caption / emotion) | `parler-mini-v1-q8_0.gguf` | Recommended English Parler checkpoint for caption / emotion control. |
| Voice cloning with noisy input audio | Any engine above + `lavasr-denoiser.gguf` | Post-process (batch path); cleans before optional enhancement. See [Speech enhancement (LavaSR)](#speech-enhancement-lavasr). |
| 48 kHz bandwidth-extended output | Any engine above + `lavasr-enhancer.gguf` | Post-process, not a TTS engine. Optional `lavasr-denoiser.gguf` first (batch path). |

GPU / backend support is documented in
[Backends & GPU acceleration](#backends--gpu-acceleration) — not duplicated
here, so this guide does not go stale when backends change.

### Capability matrix

| Model | Languages | Size (approx.) | Sample rate | Voice control | Streaming |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| `supertonic3-q4_0` / `q8_0` / `f16` | 31 | ~80 / ~126 / ~191 MB | 44.1 kHz | Baked voice ids (`F1`, `M1`, …) | Sentence streaming |
| `chatterbox-t3-turbo` + `s3gen` | English | ~1.7 GB | 24 kHz | Reference wav / voice dir | Sentence + native chunk |
| `chatterbox-t3-mtl` + `s3gen-mtl` | Multilingual | ~2.0 GB | 24 kHz | Reference wav / voice dir | Sentence + native chunk |
| `parler-indic-q8_0` | 21 Indic | ~1.3 GB | 44.1 kHz | `voice` / `emotion` / description | Sentence streaming |
| `parler-mini-v1-q8_0` | English | ~1.2 GB | 44.1 kHz | Description / templates | Sentence streaming |
| CosyVoice3 (`cosyvoice3/`) | Instruct-led (strong on Chinese + dialects) | ~2.3 GB dir (+ ~300 MB to clone) | 24 kHz | Reference wav (zero-shot / cross-lingual) + `instruct` (dialect / emotion / speed / volume / style) | Native chunk opts |
| `audio8-lm-q8_0` + codec halves | Text-led (no `language` option) | ~0.7 GB (+ ~120 MB to clone) | 44.1 kHz | Reference wav + transcript, per call too | Sentence streaming |

### Legacy Supertonic v1 / v2

| Model | Status | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `supertonic.gguf` (v1, English) | **Not recommended for new integrations** | Supertonic 3 covers English and is the edge/RTF default. No reason to prefer v1 over v3. |
| `supertonic2.gguf` (en/ko/es/pt/fr) | **Not recommended for new integrations** | Supertonic 3 is a strict superset (31 languages, same engine path, published quant tiers). Prefer `supertonic3-*.gguf`. |

Both remain loadable for existing apps and CI. New projects should stage
Supertonic 3 only unless a pinned dependency still requires v1/v2.

### Quick defaults

- **Mobile / low RTF:** `supertonic3-q4_0.gguf`
- **Product English with cloning:** Chatterbox Turbo GGUF pair
- **Indic product:** `parler-indic-q8_0.gguf`
- **Chinese dialect product:** CosyVoice3 model directory

Download the registry-published Chatterbox, Supertonic, and Parler models into
`./models`:

```bash
npm run download-models:registry
npm run download-models:registry -- --group chatterbox,supertonic3
npm run download-models:registry -- --output /path/to/models
```

CosyVoice3 and Audio8 are not currently included in that registry command.
Stage their layouts shown above from local converted artifacts. The package
converts upstream Chatterbox, Supertonic, and Parler checkpoints via a Python
venv pipeline:

```bash
npm run setup-models   # creates ./venv, installs requirements.txt, runs convert-models.sh
```

Or step-by-step:

```bash
npm run setup:venv
npm run convert-models
```

The Audio8 GGUFs are produced by the converters in
qvac-fabric-speech.cpp (`engines/tts/scripts/convert-audio8-lm-to-gguf.py`
and `convert-audio8-codec-to-gguf.py`) until they are published to the model
registry alongside the other engines.

Point the addon at a custom location via `files.modelDir` (engine
auto-detected from the gguf filenames present), or pass explicit
`files.t3Model` + `files.s3genModel` (Chatterbox) /
`files.supertonicModel` (Supertonic) / `files.parlerModel` (Parler) /
`files.cosyvoiceModelDir` (CosyVoice3 — a directory, see
[CosyVoice3 instruct](#cosyvoice3-instruct)) /
`files.audio8Lm` + `files.audio8CodecDecoder` (+ `files.audio8CodecEncoder`
to clone) (Audio8).

## Quick start

```js
const TTSGgml = require('@qvac/tts-ggml')

const model = new TTSGgml({
  files: { modelDir: './models' }, // contains chatterbox-{t3-turbo,s3gen}.gguf
  config: { language: 'en' },
  opts: { stats: true }
})

await model.load()

const response = await model.run({
  type: 'text',
  input: 'Hello from qvac tts ggml.'
})

let pcm = []
await response
  .onUpdate(data => {
    if (data && data.outputArray) pcm = pcm.concat(Array.from(data.outputArray))
  })
  .await()

// pcm is Int16 mono @ 24 kHz for Chatterbox (rate varies by engine — see data.sampleRate)
await model.unload()
```

## Streaming

### Sentence streaming — `runStreaming(asyncIter)`

Use when your text arrives as discrete sentences (e.g. buffered LLM
output) and you want the audio to flow sentence-by-sentence.  One
`onUpdate` event per input yield.

```js
async function * sentencesOverTime () {
  yield 'First sentence.'
  await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 200))
  yield 'The second arrives shortly after.'
}

const response = await model.runStreaming(sentencesOverTime())
await response.onUpdate(data => {
  // data.outputArray    — Int16 PCM for this sentence's audio
  // data.chunkIndex     — 0-based index of the yielded sentence
  // data.sentenceChunk  — the sentence text that produced this audio
}).await()
```

`runStreaming(textStream, options)` accepts a string, string array, iterable,
or async iterable. Async iterables default to `accumulateSentences: true` so
streamed fragments are buffered until a sentence delimiter is reached; strings,
arrays, and synchronous iterables default to one synthesis job per item. Set
`accumulateSentences` explicitly to override that behavior. Choose
`sentenceDelimiterPreset: 'latin'`,
`'multilingual'`, or `'cjk'`, or provide `sentenceDelimiter: RegExp`.
`maxBufferScalars` bounds buffered text and forces a flush when reached;
`flushAfterMs` flushes text that has remained incomplete for that duration.
Parler description fields and Audio8 `referenceAudio` / `referenceText` may
also be supplied in the options and remain fixed for the response.

Full runnable demo (with streaming playback):
`bare examples/chatterbox-sentence-stream-tts.js`

### Chunk streaming — `streamChunkTokens`

Use when you want the fastest possible first-audio-out **within a
single utterance**.  The C++ engine splits each synthesis into chunks
of `streamChunkTokens` speech tokens (25 ≈ 1 s of audio) and emits
audio per chunk, keeping HiFT's source cache phase-continuous across
seams so the joins are inaudible.

```js
const model = new TTSGgml({
  files: { modelDir: './models' },
  referenceAudio: './voices/jfk.wav', // optional
  streamChunkTokens: 25,              // ~1 s of audio per chunk
  streamFirstChunkTokens: 10,         // smaller first chunk = faster first-audio-out
  cfmSteps: 1,                        // 1-step meanflow: halves CFM cost
  config: { language: 'en' }
})

await model.load()

const response = await model.run({ input: 'A long sentence produces many chunks...' })
await response.onUpdate(data => {
  if (data && data.outputArray) playPcmChunk(data.outputArray)
}).await()
```

Full runnable demo (with gapless playback via `sox` or `ffplay`):
`bare examples/chatterbox-chunk-stream-tts.js`

## Voice cloning

### Chatterbox

Pass a mono wav ≥ 5 s of clean speech — the engine does the loudness
normalisation (−27 LUFS), resampling, and all conditioning (VoiceEncoder,
CAMPPlus, S3TokenizerV2, mel extraction) natively at `load()` time:

```js
const model = new TTSGgml({
  files: { modelDir: './models' },
  referenceAudio: './voices/me.wav',
  config: { language: 'en' }
})
```

Alternatively point at a pre-baked profile directory produced by the
upstream CLI's `--save-voice DIR` (loads `.npy` tensors; skips the
preprocessing entirely):

```js
new TTSGgml({
  files: { modelDir: './models' },
  voiceDir: './voices/me/',
})
```

When both are supplied, missing tensors in `voiceDir` are backfilled
from `referenceAudio`.

### Audio8

Audio8 clones from the recording plus **what is said in it**.  The codec's
analysis half (`files.audio8CodecEncoder`) encodes the recording to codes
inside the addon, and the model continues that speaker; the transcript is
what the reference turn *answers*, so a missing or wrong one degrades the
clone rather than failing loudly.  Both fields are therefore required
together, and cloning without the encoder GGUF is rejected at construction.

```js
const model = new TTSGgml({
  engine: TTSGgml.ENGINE_AUDIO8,
  files: { modelDir: './models' }, // needs audio8-codec-encoder-*.gguf present
  referenceAudio: './voices/me.wav',
  referenceText: 'Exactly what the recording says, verbatim.'
})
await model.load()

// per-call override: a different speaker, or just a corrected transcript
await model.run({
  input: 'Spoken in a third voice.',
  referenceAudio: './voices/someone-else.wav',
  referenceText: 'What that recording says.'
})
```

A per-call `referenceText` on its own corrects the transcript of the
configured recording.  A per-call `referenceAudio` replaces the voice
outright and must bring its own transcript — the configured one describes a
different recording, so it is not inherited — and a recording passed without
one is rejected before the job is queued.  `reload()` applies the same rule,
and checks the merged voice *and* the merged sampling knobs before it writes
either, so a refused reload leaves the model exactly as it was rather than
half-moved onto the configuration that was refused.

The engine caches the codes for the most recent reference, so repeating one
across calls skips the encoder.  Per-call fields also ride on the
`runStream` / `runStreaming` options, pinned for the whole response so the
cache stays hot across chunks.

### CosyVoice3

CosyVoice3 clones **zero-shot or cross-lingual**, selected by whether the
reference's transcript is provided — the same rule as the upstream
frontends.  At `load()` the native front-end tokenizes the recording
(speech_tokenizer_v3), extracts the CAM++ speaker embedding and the prompt
mel, and replaces the baked default voice; the one-time bake costs about a
second of CPU for a short clip.

Zero-shot — transcript given, so the LM is prompted with the transcript and
the reference's speech tokens (best fidelity in the reference's language):

```js
const model = new TTSGgml({
  engine: TTSGgml.ENGINE_COSYVOICE3,
  files: { cosyvoiceModelDir: './models/cosyvoice3' },
  referenceAudio: './voices/me.wav',
  promptText: 'Exactly what the recording says, verbatim.'
})
```

Cross-lingual — no transcript, timbre-only conditioning through the flow
(best when synthesizing a different language than the reference):

```js
const model = new TTSGgml({
  engine: TTSGgml.ENGINE_COSYVOICE3,
  files: { cosyvoiceModelDir: './models/cosyvoice3' },
  referenceAudio: './voices/me.wav'
})
```

`examples/cosyvoice-tts.js` demonstrates both modes end to end
(`--reference-audio` / `--prompt-text`).

The recording must be 0.5-30 s (hard limits; 5-15 s of clean speech clones
most reliably) with finite samples; multichannel input is downmixed to mono
by the engine.  Cloning needs the two add-on GGUFs —
`cosyvoice3-s3tok-*.gguf` (speech tokenizer, f16 or q8_0) and
`cosyvoice3-campplus-*.gguf` (speaker encoder) — auto-discovered under
`files.cosyvoiceModelDir` by those name prefixes, or passed explicitly as
`files.cosyvoiceS3tokModel` / `files.cosyvoiceCampplusModel`.  They are
required **only** when `referenceAudio` is set; every failure (missing
GGUFs, unreadable or out-of-range audio) rejects the load rather than
silently keeping the baked voice.  `instruct` composes with a cloned voice:
the instruction drives dialect/style while the clone supplies the timbre.
The reference is fixed at construction: there is no per-call reference
(unlike Audio8), and `reload()` re-bakes the *same* recording rather than
accepting a new one, so changing voices means constructing a new instance.

## Speech enhancement (LavaSR)

Opt-in neural post-processing that bandwidth-extends the synthesized audio to
**48 kHz** with a synthesised high band, using the LavaSR Vocos enhancer
(ConvNeXt backbone + ISTFT spec head) converted to a single GGUF. It follows the
engine's GPU intent: with `config.useGPU: true` (or `nGpuLayers`) the enhancer
runs on the GPU (Vulkan on Linux/Windows, Metal on macOS/iOS) and falls back to
CPU otherwise. It is fully backward compatible — provide no enhancer GGUF and
nothing changes.

Enhancement is enabled simply by supplying the enhancer GGUF; there is no
separate on/off flag.

```js
const model = new TTSGgml({
  engine: TTSGgml.ENGINE_SUPERTONIC,
  // Providing the enhancer GGUF is what turns enhancement on:
  files: { supertonicModel, lavasrEnhancer: 'models/lavasr/lavasr-enhancer.gguf' },
  config: { language: 'en' }
})
// The output callback now reports 48000:
//   response.onUpdate(d => { /* d.outputArray; d.sampleRate === 48000 */ })
```

The GGUF path may instead be given as `enhancer.enhancerPath` (an
`enhancer: { type: 'lavasr', enhancerPath }` block). Convert the GGUF from the
public [LavaSRcpp](https://github.com/Topping1/LavaSRcpp) ONNX release:

```bash
python scripts/convert-lavasr-enhancer-to-gguf.py \
  --backbone enhancer_backbone.onnx --spec-head enhancer_spec_head.onnx \
  --out models/lavasr/lavasr-enhancer.gguf --ftype f16   # or f32
```

Notes:

- Works for all four engines — Chatterbox, Supertonic, Parler and CosyVoice3 —
  on the batch path, sentence-level streaming, **and** the native chunk
  streaming of Chatterbox, Parler and CosyVoice3 (`streamChunkTokens > 0`).
- For native chunk streaming the enhancer runs over a sliding window with
  look-ahead + crossfade so each emitted chunk is bandwidth-extended seam-free.
  This adds **~0.34 s of look-ahead latency** (inherent to the enhancer's
  receptive field), so first-audio-out arrives a little later than un-enhanced
  streaming.
- That window re-runs the enhancer over a fixed left context + look-ahead around
  every chunk, so streamed enhancement costs a constant factor above a single
  batch pass: **~1.7×** for ~1 s chunks, ~2.7× for ~0.4 s, ~4.4× for ~0.2 s. How
  many tokens that is depends on the engine's speech-token rate (Chatterbox's S3
  tokens run at a fixed 25 Hz, so `streamChunkTokens: 25` ≈ 1 s). The factor is
  flat in utterance length, and the enhancer is only a small share of synthesis,
  so ~1 s chunks cost roughly 2% of total synthesis time.
- That extra enhancer CPU buys a real latency win on **Chatterbox**, so prefer
  larger chunks there only if enhancer CPU matters more to you than first-audio
  latency. On **CosyVoice3** it currently buys nothing: the tts-cpp engine
  computes the whole utterance and only then slices it, so chunks arrive
  progressively but first-audio latency is not yet reduced (true token2wav
  streaming is reserved upstream). Until that lands, prefer **batch** synthesis
  when enhancing CosyVoice3 — streaming there pays the reprocess cost and yields
  a seam-free result that is not bit-identical to the batch pass, with no
  latency benefit in return.
- The enhancer always runs at 48 kHz internally. By default the emitted audio
  is 48 kHz; set `config.outputSampleRate` to resample the enhanced output to a
  different rate (`TTSOutputChunk.sampleRate` reports the actual rate).
- Parler is natively 44.1 kHz, so enhancement there buys spectral detail rather
  than raw bandwidth. It also lifts a streaming restriction: Parler normally
  rejects `config.outputSampleRate` together with `streamChunkTokens` (the engine
  has no seam-free per-chunk resampler), but with the enhancer active the
  requested rate is applied inside the enhancer's overlap windows and is
  accepted.
- CosyVoice3 native chunk streaming otherwise emits only at its native 24 kHz;
  enabling the enhancer is what makes a different `config.outputSampleRate`
  valid there, since the resample happens inside the seam-free window.
- With `opts.stats`, `response.stats.enhancerBackendDevice` (`-1` none / `0` CPU
  / `1` GPU) and `enhancerBackendId` report where the enhancer actually ran.

### Denoiser

LavaSR's first stage — the UL-UNAS **denoiser**, which cleans the signal before
the enhancer bandwidth-extends it — is wired through the addon. It is enabled the
same way as the enhancer, via `files.lavasrDenoiser` (or a
`denoiser: { type: 'lavasr', denoiserPath }` block), and runs before the
enhancer (rate-preserving) on the batch path for all four engines:

```js
const model = new TTSGgml({
  engine: TTSGgml.ENGINE_SUPERTONIC,
  files: {
    supertonicModel,
    lavasrDenoiser: 'models/lavasr/lavasr-denoiser.gguf', // cleaned first…
    lavasrEnhancer: 'models/lavasr/lavasr-enhancer.gguf'  // …then upsampled
  },
  config: { language: 'en' }
})
```

Convert the GGUF from the public [LavaSRcpp](https://github.com/Topping1/LavaSRcpp)
ONNX release using the `convert-lavasr-denoiser-to-gguf.py` script shipped in the
[`qvac-fabric-speech.cpp/engines/tts`][qvac-tts-cpp] repo (this package ships only
the enhancer converter under `scripts/`):

```bash
python /path/to/tts-cpp/scripts/convert-lavasr-denoiser-to-gguf.py \
  --denoiser denoiser_core_legacy_fixed63.onnx \
  --out models/lavasr/lavasr-denoiser.gguf --ftype f16   # or f32
```

- The UL-UNAS forward runs at 16 kHz internally (resampled in/out), so the
  denoiser is **rate-preserving**: the emitted audio keeps the engine's sample
  rate. With no denoiser path the output is unchanged (full backward compat).
- Denoiser + native chunk streaming (`streamChunkTokens > 0`) is rejected up
  front for every engine — a stateful streaming denoiser is the follow-up. Use
  batch synthesis, or drop the denoiser for streaming.
- The tts-cpp UL-UNAS forward is implemented in
  [qvac-fabric-speech.cpp#78](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac-fabric-speech.cpp/pull/78)
  (scalar CPU port, validated bit-close to the ONNX reference); it requires a
  `tts-cpp` build that includes that port — see the pinned version in `vcpkg.json`.

## Backends & GPU acceleration

The addon delegates backend selection to `tts-cpp`'s registry-only
init path.  At `load()` time the engine walks the ggml-backend registry
once and picks the first available accelerator that matches the
host's policy:

| Platform                | Default backend when `useGPU: true`          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| macOS / iOS             | Metal                                        |
| Linux x64 — NVIDIA      | Vulkan (CUDA is opt-in at build via `ENABLE_CUDA`; CUDA then wins the cascade) |
| Linux — other / Windows | Vulkan                                       |
| Android — Adreno 700+   | OpenCL                                       |
| Android — Mali / others | Vulkan                                       |
| Everything else / CPU-only build | CPU                                 |

On hosts where more than one backend is usable, `TTS_CPP_GPU_BACKEND`
(`cuda` | `vulkan` | `metal` | `opencl`) pins the cascade to one backend
and fails loudly when that backend cannot be resolved; unset (or empty)
keeps the automatic preference above.

When the addon is built with `ENABLE_CUDA`, the CUDA backend ships as a
runtime-loaded module: engaging it requires the NVIDIA driver plus the CUDA
13 runtime libraries (cudart and cuBLAS, from a CUDA toolkit install)
resolvable at load time. On hosts without them — including CPU-only and
non-NVIDIA machines — the module is skipped and the addon behaves exactly as
before (Vulkan or CPU).

The module targets **compute capability 7.5 and newer**: native code for
Turing (7.5 — RTX 20xx, GTX 16xx, T4), Ampere (8.0, 8.6), Ada (8.9), Hopper
(9.0) and Blackwell (12.0, 12.1), and a JIT compile from the bundled 8.0 PTX
for anything newer that the driver caches after first use. Volta and Pascal
fall outside CUDA 13's support entirely, so they have no code path here: the
backend skips such devices at registration and the addon falls back to Vulkan
or CPU.

> `allow_arm_mali=true` for both graphs. (Earlier `tts-cpp` builds declined
> Mali for the Chatterbox / S3Gen graph and fell back to CPU there.)
>
> Parler also opts into ARM Mali Vulkan on Android. Its GPU smoke test is

### Android: dynamic backend loading

Android prebuilds enable `GGML_BACKEND_DL=ON` and ship per-arch
backend `.so` files under
`prebuilds/<bare-target>/qvac__tts-ggml/`.

The engine `dlopen()`s the highest-tier CPU variant the device's
HWCAPs support and one of the GPU `.so` files based on the policy
table above.  Hosts must pass `backendsDir: path.join(__dirname,
'prebuilds')` (or rely on the default fallback the package ships)
so the runtime knows where to look.  `openclCacheDir` is also
Android-specific; setting it to a writable path lets the OpenCL
backend persist its compiled program cache across launches.
`vulkanCacheDir` is the Vulkan analogue (Supertonic + `useGPU: true`):
setting it to a writable path persists the compiled pipeline cache
(`GGML_VK_PIPELINE_CACHE_DIR`) across launches and enables a load-time
pre-warm, so the one-time first-dispatch shader-compile cost (seconds
on Mali) is paid once per install rather than on the first `run()` of
every process.  Both are fully opt-in: unset means behaviour is
unchanged.

## Emotion & pace (cross-engine)

`emotion` and `pace` mean the same thing on every engine that supports them,
and they are set the same way: the constructor and `reload()` everywhere, plus
per call on the engines that can change them per call.  The vocabulary is owned
by tts-cpp (`include/tts-cpp/voice_controls.h`) and mirrored here; each engine
declares the subset it supports, and an unsupported value throws naming that
engine's set.

| engine | `emotion` | `pace` | per call | exact rate knob |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Parler | all 12 | slow / moderate / fast | yes | — |
| CosyVoice3 | anger, happy, neutral, sad | slow / moderate / fast | yes | — |
| Supertonic | not supported | slow / moderate / fast | no | `speed` |
| Chatterbox | not supported | not supported | — | `speed` |
| Audio8 | not supported | not supported | — | — |

The 12 canonical emotions (case-insensitive): `command`, `anger`, `narration`,
`conversation`, `disgust`, `fear`, `happy`, `neutral`, `proper noun`, `news`,
`sad`, `surprise`.  Note `anger`, not `angry`.

```js
// identical on both emotion-capable families
const model = new TTSGgml({ files, emotion: 'happy', pace: 'slow' })
await model.load()
await model.reload({ emotion: 'sad' })          // reload
await model.run({ input: text, emotion: 'sad' }) // per call
model.runStream(text, { emotion: 'news' })       // per stream
```

`speed` is a separate, unchanged knob: an exact rate multiplier on Chatterbox
and Supertonic.  `pace` is the 3-step enum; on Supertonic the two are mutually
exclusive and setting both throws.

Two per-engine properties worth knowing:

- **CosyVoice3** is trained on one instruction per synthesis, so engaging two
  controls throws rather than silently picking a winner.  Only `pace: 'moderate'`
  engages nothing, taking the plain zero-shot path -- that path keeps the prompt
  speech tokens, where an instruction would drop them.  Every emotion, `neutral`
  included, carries its own trained instruction, so it does count as the one
  instruction and conflicts with `slow` / `fast`.
- **Supertonic** maps the step onto its duration multiplier relative to the
  GGUF's own `default_speed`, so `pace: 'moderate'` is bit-identical to setting
  nothing.  It conditions the engine when the engine is built, so its `pace`
  belongs in the constructor or `reload({ pace })`; passing one to `run()` /
  `runStream()` throws rather than being silently ignored.

## Parler descriptions

Parler is **description-conditioned**: the voice is controlled by a
natural-language caption, not a voice id.  Two mutually exclusive ways to
set it (same level = constructor or per-call; setting both throws):

- `description` (alias `voiceDescription`) — a full free-text caption.
- Template fields — `voice`, `pitch`, `expressivity`, `noise`, `reverb`,
  `quality`, plus the cross-engine `emotion` / `pace` — rendered natively in
  the models' training-caption phrasing.  All optional; with nothing set the
  models' recommended fallback caption is used, so Parler works out of the box.

```js
const model = new TTSGgml({
  files: { parlerModel: './models/parler-indic-q8_0.gguf' },
  voice: 'Rohit', // speaker name (indic: per-language voices, e.g. hi Rohit/Divya, gu Yash/Neha)
  emotion: 'happy'
})
await model.load()

// per-call override: template fields merge over the constructor's
await model.run({ input: 'आज मौसम बहुत अच्छा है।', emotion: 'sad' })
```

The indic model card lists 10 officially emotion-tested languages (Assamese,
Bengali, Bodo, Dogri, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Sanskrit, Nepali, Tamil);
elsewhere — including Hindi/Gujarati and the English mini/large models —
emotion conditioning exists but is best-effort.  Per-call fields ride on
`run()` input and the `runStream`/`runStreaming` options (one description is
pinned per streaming response, keeping the native T5 cross-attention cache
hot).  Parler supports Metal GPU offload on Apple and the vendor-selected
Android GPU backend (`useGPU: true` / `nGpuLayers`), including Vulkan on ARM
Mali. Unsupported or unavailable backends fall back to CPU. It emits native
44.1 kHz.

## CosyVoice3 instruct

Beyond `emotion` / `pace` above, CosyVoice3 accepts a natural-language
instruction for the controls that have no canonical cross-engine vocabulary
yet: Chinese dialect, volume, and playful style.  Point the addon at the model
directory (auto-detected from `cosyvoice3-llm-*.gguf`) and set `instruct` —
either a raw instruction string, or a structured object with up to one control,
resolved by precedence `dialect > volume > style`:

```js
const model = new TTSGgml({
  files: { cosyvoiceModelDir: './models/cosyvoice3' },
  instruct: { dialect: 'cantonese' } // or { volume: ... } / { style: ... } / a raw string
})
await model.load()
await model.run({ input: 'Hello from an on-device C++ pipeline.' })
```

`instruct` counts toward the one-instruction rule, so combining it with
`emotion` or `pace` throws.  An unknown `instruct` key or an invalid value
throws at construction, listing the valid set; with nothing set the model runs
zero-shot on the baked voice (or a [cloned one](#cosyvoice3) — `instruct`
composes with `referenceAudio`, the instruction driving dialect/style while
the clone supplies the timbre).  Other CosyVoice3-only options: `promptText`
(the reference transcript — see Voice cloning); `streamLeftContextTokens` is
reserved / not yet effective (the pinned engine accepts but does not read it).
CosyVoice3 emits native **24 kHz** and runs on **CPU** by default; GPU offload
is opt-in via `useGPU` / `nGpuLayers` on Metal (Apple), Vulkan (desktop
Linux / Windows), and Android's OpenCL/Adreno path (`openclCacheDir` persists
its compiled-kernel cache), with other hosts falling back to CPU.

## Audio8

Audio8 is a **DualAR** model: a 24-layer autoregressive transformer picks one
semantic token per 46 ms frame, a 4-layer head fills the seven acoustic
codebooks under it, and a DAC-style neural codec turns the eight codes back
into 44.1 kHz audio.  It ships as three GGUFs because they have different
lifetimes — the language model and the codec's synthesis half run on every
synthesis, the analysis half only to enrol a voice — so a text-only
deployment can omit `files.audio8CodecEncoder` entirely.

```js
const model = new TTSGgml({
  engine: TTSGgml.ENGINE_AUDIO8,
  files: { modelDir: './models' },
  temperature: 0.7,
  topP: 0.9,
  opts: { stats: true }
})
await model.load()
await model.run({ input: 'Hello from a fully on-device pipeline.' })
```

Sampling is **repetition-aware**: a semantic token that repeats one from the
recent window is re-drawn under a narrower nucleus at a higher temperature,
which is what keeps the model out of the babble attractor that pure top-p
falls into.  `greedy: true` takes the argmax instead and ignores
`temperature` / `topK` / `topP`; it is reproducible but noticeably flatter.
`maxFrames` caps generation in codec frames (~21.5/s of audio).

Audio8 runs on CPU by default. Set `config.useGPU: true` or `nGpuLayers: 99`
to offload the language model and codec graphs to Metal (macOS / iOS), CUDA or
Vulkan (desktop Linux), Vulkan (Windows) or OpenCL (Android / Adreno). If none of those is
available, the engine falls back to CPU and sets
`response.stats.gpuUnsupported`. Voice cloning uses the same backend and adds
a one-off encode when a new reference recording is supplied.

| `files.cosyvoiceCampplusModel` | string | —         | CosyVoice3 CAM++ speaker-encoder GGUF; needed only with `referenceAudio` (auto-discovered as `cosyvoice3-campplus-*.gguf`) |
| `files.cosyvoiceLlmModelPath` / `cosyvoiceFlowModelPath` / `cosyvoiceHiftModelPath` | string | — | Per-component overrides for the CosyVoice3 model dir |
| `files.audio8Lm`          | string     | —          | Audio8 DualAR language model GGUF (overrides `modelDir`) |
| `files.audio8CodecDecoder`| string     | —          | Audio8 codec synthesis half — codes to wav (overrides `modelDir`) |
| `files.audio8CodecEncoder`| string     | —          | Audio8 codec analysis half — wav to codes; only needed to clone a voice |
| `files.lavasrEnhancer`    | string     | —          | LavaSR enhancer GGUF — supplying it turns on 48 kHz enhancement |
| `files.lavasrDenoiser`    | string     | —          | LavaSR denoiser GGUF — supplying it turns on denoising (batch only) |
| `engine`                  | string     | auto       | Force `'chatterbox'`, `'supertonic'`, `'cosyvoice3'`, `'parler'` or `'audio8'` (`TTSGgml.ENGINE_CHATTERBOX` / `ENGINE_SUPERTONIC` / `ENGINE_COSYVOICE3` / `ENGINE_PARLER` / `ENGINE_AUDIO8`); auto-detected from the GGUFs present otherwise |
| `referenceAudio`          | string     | —          | Wav to clone (Chatterbox: mono, ≥ 5 s; CosyVoice3: 0.5-30 s, multichannel downmixed to mono, needs the s3tok + campplus GGUFs; Audio8: also needs `referenceText`).  Audio8 accepts it per call too |
| `referenceText`           | string     | —          | Audio8-only: what `referenceAudio` says, verbatim.  Required whenever a reference is set; accepted per call |
| `voiceDir`                | string     | —          | Pre-baked voice profile |

| `nGpuLayers`              | number     | 0          | Layers offloaded to GPU (mirrors `useGPU`; pass `99` to offload all) |
| `nCtx`                    | number     | 4096       | Chatterbox T3 context limit for the prompt plus generated speech tokens (25 tokens ≈ 1 s of audio). The KV cache is allocated up front at this length, so the 4096-token default directly bounds memory. Pass `0` to use the GGUF metadata value |
| `kvCacheType`             | string     | `f16`      | T3 KV-cache dtype: `f32` \| `f16` \| `q8_0`.  `f16` (~50% of f32) is the safe cross-backend default.  `q8_0` stores the cache at ~27% of f32 and decodes 20-30% faster on Metal, but only works on backends with a q8_0 CONT op (CPU, CUDA) — it hard-aborts the multilingual model on Metal, so it is opt-in.  Turbo greedy decoding is byte-identical across all three (upstream-validated).  Pass `f32` for bit-exact pre-quantisation behaviour |
| `threads`                 | number     | hw.concurrency capped at 4 | |
| `streamChunkTokens`       | number     | 0          | **>0 enables native chunk streaming** |

| `voice` / `voiceName`     | string     | —          | Supertonic voice id (e.g. `'F1'`, `'M1'`); Parler template speaker name (e.g. `'Laura'`, `'Rohit'`) |
| `steps` / `numInferenceSteps` | number | GGUF default | Supertonic vector-estimator CFM steps (`0` = GGUF default) |
| `noiseNpyPath`            | string     | —          | Supertonic: optional fixed CFM noise `.npy` for reproducibility |
| `description` / `voiceDescription` | string | fallback caption | Parler-only: full free-text voice description (mutually exclusive with the template fields) |
| `emotion`, `pace`        | string     | —          | Cross-engine conditioning (see [Emotion & pace](#emotion--pace-cross-engine)); an unsupported value errors listing what that engine supports |
| `pitch`, `expressivity`, `noise`, `reverb`, `quality` | string | — | Parler-only template fields (see [Parler descriptions](#parler-descriptions)); invalid values error listing the valid set |
| `temperature` / `topK` / `topP` | number | engine defaults | Parler + Audio8 sampling knobs (omit for the engine's own defaults — Parler temp 1.0 / top-k 50, Audio8 temp 0.7 / top-k 50 / top-p 0.9; `topP` in `(0, 1]`) |
| `maxFrames`               | number     | engine max | Parler + Audio8 generation cap in frames (Parler ~86/s of audio, Audio8 ~21.5/s); `0` = model default, Parler rejects 1–9 |
| `greedy`                  | boolean    | `false`    | Audio8-only: take the argmax instead of sampling; ignores `temperature` / `topK` / `topP` |
| `minNewTokens`            | number     | GGUF default | Parler-only minimum tokens before EOS (`-1` = model default) |
| `normalizeNumbers`        | boolean    | `true`     | Parler-only: expand digits before tokenization (English words; script-native digits on indic) — parler voices raw digits badly |
| `instruct`                | object \| string | —    | CosyVoice3-only: instruction controls (`dialect` / `volume` / `style`, resolved by precedence in that order) or a raw instruction string; an unknown key or invalid value throws, and it counts toward the one-instruction rule (see [CosyVoice3 instruct](#cosyvoice3-instruct)) |
| `promptText`              | string     | —          | CosyVoice3-only: verbatim transcript of `referenceAudio` — set for zero-shot cloning, omit for cross-lingual; without a reference it overrides the baked voice's transcript |
| `streamLeftContextTokens` | number     | —          | CosyVoice3-only: intended native chunk-streaming left-context tokens. Reserved / not yet effective — the pinned engine accepts but does not read it |
| `mecabDictDir`            | string     | —          | Chatterbox MTL Japanese (`ja`): compiled MeCab/IPAdic dictionary directory |
| `cangjieTsvPath`          | string     | —          | Chatterbox MTL Chinese (`zh`): `Cangjie5_TC` TSV path |
| `backendsDir`             | string     | `path.join(__dirname, 'prebuilds')` | Root dir the addon scans for dynamically-loaded ggml backend `.so` files.  Required on Android (host should pass `path.join(__dirname, 'prebuilds')`); ignored on platforms that statically link the backend |
| `openclCacheDir`          | string     | unset      | Android-only: directory where the OpenCL backend persists its compiled program-binary cache.  Setting it across runs avoids re-JITing the kernels on every fresh process |
| `vulkanCacheDir`          | string     | unset      | Supertonic + `useGPU: true` only: writable directory where the Vulkan backend persists its compiled pipeline cache (`GGML_VK_PIPELINE_CACHE_DIR`).  Moves the one-time first-dispatch pipeline-compile cost (seconds on Mali) off the first `run()` — paid once per install instead of once per process — and enables a load-time pre-warm.  Fully opt-in: unset -> no cross-process cache, no pre-warm, behaviour unchanged |
| `config.language`         | string     | `"en"`     | Chatterbox MTL accepts `es/fr/de/pt/it/zh/ja/ko/...`; turbo & Supertonic are English |
| `config.useGPU`           | boolean    | `false`    | Set to `true` to route through Metal / CUDA / Vulkan / OpenCL if available. Honored for Chatterbox/Supertonic on GPU-capable hosts (including Android, per `tts-cpp`'s per-vendor allowlist); Parler is validated on Apple/Metal and Android/ARM Mali Vulkan; CosyVoice3 and Audio8 offload on Apple/Metal, desktop linux CUDA/Vulkan, Windows Vulkan, and Android OpenCL/Adreno. Unsupported backends fall back to CPU. See [Backends & GPU acceleration](#backends--gpu-acceleration) |
| `config.outputSampleRate` | number     | — (engine-native) | Resample the output to this rate (8000–192000 Hz). Omit to keep the engine-native rate (Chatterbox 24 kHz, Supertonic / Parler / Audio8 44.1 kHz, CosyVoice3 24 kHz, enhancer 48 kHz). Parler native chunk streaming accepts a non-native rate only with the enhancer active |
| `opts.stats`              | boolean    | `false`    | Populate `response.stats` with RTF, `backendDevice` (0=CPU, 1=GPU), `backendId` (0=CPU, 1=Metal, 2=CUDA, 3=Vulkan, 4=OpenCL, 99=other), and — when an enhancer is active — `enhancerBackendDevice` / `enhancerBackendId` |
| `exclusiveRun`            | boolean    | `false`    | **Top-level** option (not under `opts`): serialize overlapping streaming runs |

### Methods

- `await model.load()` — construct the native engine (loads T3, preloads
  S3Gen, bakes voice conditioning).  Subsequent `run()` calls reuse all
  of it.
- `await model.unload()` — release everything.  Idempotent.
- `await model.reload(newConfig)` — re-create the engine with a new
  config (`language`, `useGPU`, `outputSampleRate`, …).
- `await model.destroy()` — `unload()` + mark this instance dead.
- `await model.cancel()` — best-effort cancel of any in-flight run.
- `model.run({ input, type: 'text' })` → `QvacResponse`.
- `model.run({ input, streamOutput: true })` → sentence-chunked
  synthesis driven by the JS-side sentence splitter (see
  `lib/textChunker.js`).  Equivalent to `runStream(input)`.
- `model.run({ input, signal })` → pass an `AbortSignal` to cancel a
  **non-streaming** run: when the signal aborts, `response.await()` rejects
  with the abort reason.  An already-aborted signal rejects deterministically
  without dispatching the engine (no native interrupt).  **Ignored when
  `streamOutput: true`** (and on `runStream` / `runStreaming`) — the streaming
  path does not thread the signal, so passing it there is a silent no-op.
- `model.runStream(text, { locale?, maxChunkScalars? })` → same as
  above, but the options read more naturally for the "split this long
  string" use case.
- `model.runStreaming(textStream, opts)` → streaming input + streaming
  output. `opts` accepts `accumulateSentences`, `sentenceDelimiter`,
  `sentenceDelimiterPreset`, `maxBufferScalars`, `flushAfterMs`, Parler
  description fields, and Audio8 reference fields (see
  [Sentence streaming](#sentence-streaming--runstreamingasynciter)).

### Response shape

All `run*` methods return a `QvacResponse` (from `@qvac/infer-base`):

```js
response.onUpdate(data => {
  data.outputArray   // Int16Array — mono PCM
  data.sampleRate    // actual rate: Chatterbox 24000, Supertonic/Parler/Audio8 44100, enhancer 48000
  data.chunkIndex    // present on sentence-streaming events only
  data.sentenceChunk // present on sentence-streaming events only
})
await response.await()

// response.stats — only when constructor had `opts: { stats: true }`
response.stats.totalTime         // seconds
response.stats.realTimeFactor    // synthesis time / audio duration
response.stats.audioDurationMs
response.stats.totalSamples
response.stats.tokensPerSecond   // Audio8 counts codec frames, the others characters

### Text helpers

The sentence splitter is available from
`@qvac/tts-ggml/text-chunker` as `splitTtsText`. The incremental sentence
buffer is available from `@qvac/tts-ggml/text-stream-accumulator` as
`accumulateTextStream`. The existing
`@qvac/tts-ggml/lib/textStreamAccumulator.js` deep path remains supported.

### Errors

`QvacErrorAddonTTSGgml` and `ERR_CODES` are exported from the package root:

```js
const {
  QvacErrorAddonTTSGgml,
  ERR_CODES
} = require('@qvac/tts-ggml')
```

## Examples

Runnable demos under `examples/`:

| Script | Demonstrates |
|---|---|
| `chatterbox-tts.js` | Batch synth + wav dump. `bare examples/chatterbox-tts.js "Hello"` |
| `chatterbox-mtl-tts.js` | Multilingual Chatterbox synthesis |
| `chatterbox-mtl-sweep-tts.js` | Multilingual Chatterbox sweep across languages |
| `chatterbox-adjust-speed.js` | Speaking-rate (`speed`) control |
| `chatterbox-sentence-stream-tts.js` | `runStreaming()` over an async iterator of sentences, with gapless streaming playback |
| `chatterbox-chunk-stream-tts.js` | Native per-chunk PCM streaming via `streamChunkTokens`, with gapless streaming playback |
| `chatterbox-enhanced.js` | Chatterbox + LavaSR 48 kHz enhancement (batch). `bare examples/chatterbox-enhanced.js "Hello"` |
| `supertonic-tts.js` | Supertonic batch synth. `bare examples/supertonic-tts.js "Hello"` |
| `supertonic-mtl-tts.js` | Multilingual Supertonic synthesis |
| `supertonic-mtl-sweep-tts.js` | Multilingual Supertonic sweep across languages |
| `supertonic-sentence-stream-tts.js` | Supertonic sentence-level streaming |
| `supertonic-enhanced.js` | Supertonic + LavaSR 48 kHz enhancement. `bare examples/supertonic-enhanced.js "Hello"` |
| `parler-tts.js` | Parler batch synth with voice/emotion templates. `bare examples/parler-tts.js "Hello" Laura happy` |
| `parler-enhanced.js` | Parler + LavaSR 48 kHz enhancement. `bare examples/parler-enhanced.js "Hello" Laura happy` |
| `cosyvoice-tts.js` | CosyVoice3 batch synth with the cross-engine emotion option (24 kHz; CPU by default, `--gpu` opts into Metal / desktop Vulkan / Android GPU). `bare examples/cosyvoice-tts.js --gpu "Hello" happy` |
| `cosyvoice-enhanced.js` | CosyVoice3 + LavaSR 48 kHz enhancement (add `--denoise` for the denoiser). `bare examples/cosyvoice-enhanced.js "Hello"` |
| `audio8-tts.js` | Audio8 batch synth, optionally cloning a reference. Set `QVAC_TTS_AUDIO8_GPU=1` for the desktop GPU backend (CUDA or Vulkan on linux, Vulkan on Windows). `bare examples/audio8-tts.js "Hello" voice.wav "What it says."` |

The two streaming examples feed PCM into a single long-running
`sox play` / `ffplay` process so chunks play back-to-back without any
per-chunk spawn gaps — install one of them (`brew install sox` or
`brew install ffmpeg` on macOS) to enable playback.  Absent a player
the demos still run and write the concatenated wav.

## Testing

```bash
npm run test:unit          # mocked binding; fast
npm run test:integration   # spins up the real engine; needs models
npm run test               # both
```

Integration tests scan a few candidate `models/` directories for the
required GGUFs (see `test/utils/downloadModel.js`) and skip cleanly when
files are absent.  They cover, across the engines:

* batch synthesis with full RuntimeStats,
* sentence-level streaming (`runStream` / `run({ streamOutput: true })`
  / `runStreaming` over async iterators),
* native sub-sentence chunk streaming (Chatterbox-only via
  `streamChunkTokens`),
* sequential-run / fresh-instance / reload-stability behaviour,
* strict GPU-backend assertion via `response.stats.backendDevice` +
  `backendId` (set `NO_GPU=true` to skip on CPU-only runners,
  `QVAC_TTS_GPU_SMOKE_RELAX=1` to downgrade the strict gate to a
  warning),
* multilingual Chatterbox sweep (es/fr/de/pt) via `chatterbox-mtl.test.js`,
* on darwin the Chatterbox English batch path is additionally verified
  for WER against the synthesized audio (whisper-small via the
  `@qvac/asr-ggml` development dependency).

To stress-test long inputs, set `INPUT_SENTENCES=medium` (or `long`)
and re-run the integration suite — `addon.test.js` reads the env var to
pick its sentence corpus from `test/data/sentences-{medium,long}.js`.

## Build from source

Prerequisites: `clang` with C++20 support, CMake ≥ 3.25,
[vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) (set `VCPKG_ROOT`), `bare-make`.

```bash
npm install
npx bare-make generate      # configures + fetches the tts-cpp port
npx bare-make build
npx bare-make install       # copies the .bare into prebuilds/<triple>/
```

The vcpkg port is hosted in
[`tetherto/qvac-registry-vcpkg`][registry] and pulls
[`qvac-tts.cpp`][qvac-tts-cpp] at a pinned REF.  See
[`vcpkg-configuration.json`](./vcpkg-configuration.json) for the
baseline commit.

GPU backends are controlled by the `speech-cpp` port's vcpkg features:
`metal` (default on osx/ios), `vulkan` (default on
linux/windows/android), `opencl` (default on android), and `cuda`
(opt-in via the addon's `ENABLE_CUDA` cmake option).
On Android the port is configured with
`GGML_BACKEND_DL=ON` + `GGML_CPU_ALL_VARIANTS=ON`, so the build
produces per-arch CPU + Vulkan + OpenCL `.so` files alongside the
`.bare` module instead of statically linking; the resulting prebuilds
layout is what the `backendsDir` option expects (see
[Backends & GPU acceleration](#backends--gpu-acceleration)).

## Troubleshooting

**`t3 model not found` / `supertonic model not found`** — the paths in
`files` are wrong or the GGUFs weren't generated.  Run
`npm run setup-models` (creates the Python venv and converts the
upstream checkpoints into the four / five expected GGUF files).

**`VoiceEncoder forward failed`** when passing `referenceAudio`** —
the reference wav is likely < 5 s of clean speech.  Make it longer
(10–15 s gives the best similarity).

**Slower-than-expected RTF on darwin** — set `config: { useGPU: true }`
(the default is now CPU; see [Constructor](#constructor--new-ttsggmloptions)
+ [Backends & GPU acceleration](#backends--gpu-acceleration)) and
confirm the port was built with the `metal` feature.  Also confirm
your reference wav's mel was baked (`Using C++ VoiceEncoder` /
`C++ S3TokenizerV2` messages in the log) — if voice conditioning
falls back to CPU, a chunk of the first-call overhead is visible in
RTF.

**Slow-but-otherwise-fine RTF on Android** — set `config: { useGPU:
true }` (the default is CPU; see
[Backends & GPU acceleration](#backends--gpu-acceleration)) and confirm
your device's GPU is on `tts-cpp`'s per-vendor allowlist.  Both Chatterbox
and Supertonic run on the GPU on Adreno, Xclipse, and Mali (Adreno uses
OpenCL; Xclipse and Mali use Vulkan).
